            <h3>Throughout the process of this project, we found that the term
            <em>smart home</em> could mean many different things
            to many different people. Some believe that having Netflix on their TV is a sophisticated smart home interaction while some dream of fully-automated houses catering to their every need. Regardless of your view, the smart home space has become increasingly difficult to ignore. Yet despite this, there are relatively few applications that have achieved widespread adoption. The question then becomes -

            <h2 class="article-header"><span class="subtitle-block">01 &mdash;</span>What's out there?</h2>
            <p>The brief given by DESIGNATION involved the creation of an application that connects a variety of smart home devices together into a single platform. While the smart home market is quickly emerging, the devices remain fragmented and there is no single unifying platform that defines the space. Before we began to explore potential solutions, the problem needed to be fully understood. This was done through initial domain research and informational user interviews.
            </p>

            <p>Through domain research, we quickly found that existing products and platforms can be split into two major categories:</p>

            <section class="emphasis-list">
              <ul>
                <li><span class="list-points">A.</span>Complex products that required a certain level of tech-savviness in order to make the most of them.</li>
                <li><span class="list-points">B.</span>Single purpose products that are limited in scope.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <p>This initial research showed that there is a gap in the market for a product that allows for sophisticated interactions but has a user-friendly interface. This became an important consideration for our group as we continued to develop our solution.

              <h2 class="article-header"><span class="subtitle-block">02 &mdash;</span>Who's out there?</h2>
              <p>In order to determine how existing users use their smart home technology or if they use it at all, we conducted a total of 12 informational interviews. There was emphasis placed on the types of technology that the user owns currently and the decision making process that went into that purchase. We were also interested in their knowledge of the smart home space and their immediate reaction when they hear the term <em>smart home</em>.
              </p>

              <p>After conducting the interviews, the information gathered from the sessions were condensed into individual Post-It's each containing a singular piece of information that was deemed important. These were then sorted through the process of affinity mapping in which each member of the group began to organize the Post-It's into logical groups.
              </p>

              <p>This allowed us to quickly sort through the information and to identify the important patterns within. After several rounds of affinity mapping, we determined that three main patterns emerged:

              <section class="emphasis-list-light">
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="list-points">A.</span>Users that claim to be tech-savvy found smart home devices to be gimmicky and could not find an appropriate use case for them.
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="list-points">B.</span>Renters place less emphasis on investing in their non-permanent homes while homeowners place security over other factors including costs.
                  </li>
                  <li><span class="list-points">C.</span>Users value simple interactions.
                  </li>
                </ul>
