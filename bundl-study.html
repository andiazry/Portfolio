          <h3>Throughout the process of this project, we found that the term
          <em>smart home</em> can mean many different things
          to many different people. Some think that having Netflix on their TV is a sophisticated smart home interaction while some dream of fully-automated houses catering to their every need. Regardless of your view, the smart home space has become increasingly difficult to ignore. Yet despite this,
          there are relatively few applications that have achieved widespread adoption. The question then becomes - <span class="emphasis-copy">How can we bridge the
          gap between the products and the consumer?</span></h3>

          <h2 class="article-header">01 &mdash; Background</h2>
          <p>The brief given by DESIGNATION involved the creation of an application that connects a variety of smart home devices together into a single platform. While the smart home market is quickly emerging, the devices remain fragmented and there is no single unifying platform that defines the space. Before we could begin to explore solutions, the problem needed to be fully understood. This was done through initial domain research and informational user interviews.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Through domain research, we quickly found that existing products and platforms can be split into two major categories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complex products that required a certain level of tech-savviness in order to make the most of them.</li>
            <li>Single purpose products that are limited in scope.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This initial research showed that there is a gap in the market for a product that allows for sophisticated interactions but has a user-friendly interface. This became an important consideration for our group as we continued to develop our solution.
